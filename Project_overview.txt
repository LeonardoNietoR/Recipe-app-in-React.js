 1. Show on the main page diferent options by default: Cook in 30 minutes, dish types (italian, thai, american, jamapese), health labels, picks of the day, vegetarian. Besides that, it should display different options to go straight to one specific type of food. (like button for italian...).

 1.1 to get random popular recipes it is possible to use "random" parameter.
